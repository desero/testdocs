On the Presslabs Dashboard we have three levels of permission, frequently addressed as `roles`. You can read more about this topic in our [Collaborators section](../dashboard/site-management/collaborators.md).

The site owner is usually the publisher, and the developer is the one in charge of improving the site code. Sometimes, the publisher and the developer are one and the same, but most of the time there are two different people, in charge of different things. This is why we thought it would be useful to put together a list of pages of interest in our docs, for publishers and developers alike.

The following links do not include all the materials included in our documentation; it's only a guide to help you find articles of interest.
